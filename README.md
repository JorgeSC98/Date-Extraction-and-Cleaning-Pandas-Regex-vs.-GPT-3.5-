# Date-Extraction-and-Cleaning-Pandas-Regex-vs.-GPT-3.5-
This repository contains a comparative analysis of two different approaches to extract and clean dates embedded within sentences in a dataset. The first approach involves utilizing regular Python libraries and regular expressions (regex) for date extraction and cleaning. The second approach employs OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for the same task.The goal of this project is to explore the effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of these two methods in handling date extraction and cleaning tasks.

Project Objectives:

*Implement a Python script using pandas and regex to extract and clean dates from sentences in a dataset.

*Develop a script that utilizes the GPT-3.5 model to extract and clean dates from the same dataset.

*Compare the performance of the two methods
